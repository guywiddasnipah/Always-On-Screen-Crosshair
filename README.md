# Always-On-Screen-Crosshair

This CSS toggles on the visibility of the in-game static crosshair for all weapons including Vita.

*Please note that this will conflict with the dynamic crosshair if that's what you're using, where both the static and dynamic crosshair will be superimposed over each other. In order to avoid the same, go to Kirka's [General Settings](https://kirka.io/settings/general) and set the Crosshair Type to 'Static'

A custom crosshair as usual can be applied in [Settings > Mods](https://kirka.io/settings/mods).
